### **How It Works**

Smart Tab Organiser adds a simple, intuitive interface to your browser.

1.  Click the icon to see a full analysis of your tabs.
2.  Accept the AI-suggested groups or create your own.
3.  Save important sessions for later.
4.  Enjoy a faster, more organized browsing experience!

### **Permissions Justification**

We only ask for the permissions we absolutely need to provide our core features:

- **Tabs, Tab Groups, Windows**: Required to find, analyze, move, and organize your tabs into groups and new windows.
- **Storage**: Needed to save your settings and sessions directly on your computer.
- **Scripting & Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`)**: To power our AI grouping feature, the extension needs to be able to read the text content of your open tabs. This permission is **only** used for this purpose, and all analysis is performed locally.

Take control of your tabs and unleash your productivity. Add Smart Tab Organiser to Chrome today!
