# User Guide: Smart Tab Organiser

Welcome to Smart Tab Organiser! This guide will help you get the most out of the extension.

## Opening the Extension

Click the Smart Tab Organiser icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the main popup window. The first time you open it, you can click the **"❓"** icon for an interactive tour of the key features.

## Main Views

The popup is organized into two main views: **Analyzer** and **Saved**. You can switch between them using the tabs at the top.

### 1. Analyzer View

This is the default view. It provides tools to organize and understand your current tabs.

#### Main Actions

- **Organize All Tabs**: Click this to automatically group all of your open, ungrouped tabs. The extension will create new windows, each containing a group of tabs. If you have over 250 tabs, they will be organized into windows of 50; otherwise, they will be in windows of 25.
- **Close Duplicate Tabs**: Instantly finds and closes any tabs that are duplicates, cleaning up your workspace with a single click.
- **Undo/Redo**: Accidentally organized or closed a group? No problem. Use the Undo (`Undo`) and Redo (`Redo`) buttons to reverse or reapply your last action.

#### Comprehensive Stats

The dashboard gives you an at-a-glance overview of your browser session:

- **Total Tabs, Windows, and Groups**: A quick count of your browser's state.
- **Audible Tabs (Interactive)**: Shows how many tabs are currently playing sound. **Click this stat** to instantly jump to the noisy tab.
- **Duplicate Tabs**: Counts how many tabs are open to the exact same URL. Use the "Close Duplicate Tabs" button to clean them up.
- **Memory Savers**: Shows the number of tabs Chrome has put to sleep to save memory.

#### Domain Analysis

This section lists all websites where you have multiple tabs open. For each website, you can:

- **Save**: Closes all tabs from that domain and adds them to your "Saved" list for later.
- **Organize**: Groups just the tabs for that specific website.
- **Close All**: Closes all tabs for that website.
- **Copy**: Copies all the URLs for that website to your clipboard.

#### Top Domains by Tab Count

A pie chart showing the 5 websites you have the most tabs open for, giving you a visual sense of your current session.

### 2. Saved View

This view holds all the tab groups you've saved for later, creating a clean workspace without losing important pages.

- **How to Save**: In the "Analyzer" view, find a domain you want to save and click the green "Save" button. All tabs from that domain will be closed and added to your saved list.
- **Restore a Group**: In the "Saved" view, find the group you want to bring back and click "Restore". All its tabs will open in a new window, and the group will be removed from your saved list.
- **Delete a Group**: If you no longer need a saved group, click the "Delete" button to permanently remove it.

## Settings & Options

You can access the main settings page by clicking the **"⚙️"** icon in the popup header or by right-clicking the extension icon and choosing "Options".

On the options page, you can:

- **Manage Sessions**: Save or restore your entire browser state (all windows and tabs).
- **Configure Defaults**: Set preferences for auto-organization and default group colors.
- **Manage Data**: Reset all settings or clear your saved sessions and groups.
