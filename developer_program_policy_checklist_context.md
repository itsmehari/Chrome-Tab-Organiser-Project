# Developer Program Policy Compliance Checklist

This document is a final check based on a deep reading of the [Chrome Web Store Program Policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies). It verifies that the "Smart Tab Organiser" extension complies with all key requirements.

---

### ✅ 1. Safety & Content

- **[x] No Malicious Products**: The extension does not contain malware, viruses, or spyware. It does not facilitate unauthorized access to websites or copyrighted content.
- **[x] No Cryptocurrency Mining**: Confirmed that no cryptocurrency mining scripts are included or executed.
- **[x] No Hate Speech or Violence**: The extension's content and purpose are neutral and productivity-focused.
- **[x] No Regulated Goods**: The extension does not promote or facilitate the sale of regulated goods or illegal activities.
- **[x] No Mature Content**: The extension is suitable for all ages and does not contain sexually explicit or graphically violent content.

---

### ✅ 2. User Privacy & Data Handling

- **[x] Accurate Privacy Policy**: A comprehensive privacy policy exists on the website, clearly linked from the `options.html` page.
- **[x] Limited Use Policy**:
  - Data usage is strictly limited to the primary feature of analyzing tab content for local grouping.
  - The collection of web browsing activity is justified as it is essential for a user-facing feature (**AI Content Grouping**) which is prominently described in the store listing and UI.
- **[x] No Data Sharing**: The privacy policy and the extension's architecture confirm that user data is not shared with any third parties. All processing is local.

---

### ✅ 3. Functionality & Quality

- **[x] Minimum Functionality**: The extension provides significant, unique utility and is not merely a wrapper for a website or a launcher for another app.
- **[x] No Broken Functionality**: All features described in the documentation (`popup`, `options`, `background` logic) are designed to be fully functional.
- **[x] No Deceptive Behavior**: The extension's functionality directly matches its description. There are no hidden features, and the user is in full control of all actions.

---

### ✅ 4. Store Listing & Promotion

- **[x] No Keyword Spam**: The store description generated in `STORE_LISTING_CONTENT.md` is well-written, clear, and uses keywords appropriately in context, avoiding lists or unnatural repetition.
- **[x] No Anonymous Testimonials**: The store description is free of unattributed user testimonials.
- **[x] Accurate Metadata**: All information in `manifest.json` is accurate and reflects the extension's purpose.

---

### ✅ 5. Technical Requirements (Manifest V3)

- **[x] Code Readability**: The source code is not obfuscated. The packaging script only copies the source JS files, and while minification would be allowed, obfuscation is not used.
- **[x] Proper API Use**: The extension uses standard Chrome APIs (`tabs`, `tabGroups`, `storage`, `scripting`, `offscreen`) for their intended purposes.
- **[x] No Remote Logic**: The extension's logic is fully self-contained.
  - It does not execute scripts from remote sources.
  - It does not use `eval()` on remote data.
  - Third-party libraries (`Chart.js`, `Compromise`) are included locally within the package.

---

### Final Verification Status: ✅ **PASS**

This deep check confirms that the project adheres to the specific and detailed requirements of the Chrome Web Store Program Policies. The extension is well-architected to meet the standards for safety, privacy, and technical compliance.
